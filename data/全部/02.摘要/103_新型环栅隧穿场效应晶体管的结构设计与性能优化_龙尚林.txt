摘要
多年来，随着集成电路的快速发展，晶体管的工艺尺寸从微米级 缩小到纳米级。工艺尺寸的缩小使得集成电路的集成度提高，性能提 升。不过，随着工艺尺寸的缩小，在金属氧化物半导体场效应晶体管 (MOSFETs)中，短沟道效应、窄沟道效应、漏极引入势垒降低效应等 二级效应愈发明显，这些效应不仅影响晶体管的性能，还阻碍着摩尔 定律的延续。因此，国内外研究者们开始研究新型晶体管，期望可以 解决这些问题。隧穿场效应晶体管(TFETs)基于带带隧穿的工作原理, 具有低功耗、可以突破60mV/dec的玻尔兹曼限制、高开关电流比等 优点，是最有希望应用于下一代集成电路中的新型器件之一。但是, TFETs器件具有双极性效应、开态电流低、亚阈值斜率不稳定的缺点。 针对TFETs的缺点，本论文进行了下面的研究：
首先，本论文提岀了一种新型的TFET器件：错环绕源极环栅隧穿场效应晶体管(GAS GAATFET)。通过 Sentaurus TCAD 对 GAS GAA TFET、硅源极环栅TFET (Si GAA TFET)和错源极环栅TFET(Ge- sourceGAATFET)三种器件进行仿真实验。实验结果表明，错环绕源 极结构使得GAS GAA TFET的开态电流和Ge-source GAA TFET达 到了同一水平，约为SiGAATFET的1(^倍，同时，GASGAATFET 的关态电流降低为Ge-source GAATFET的五分之一。另外,GAS GAA TFET的亚阈值斜率的方差是三种器件中的最小值,证明了 GASGAA TFET的亚阈值斜率比其他两种器件更稳定。因此，GASGAATFET 具有高开态电流和稳定的亚阈值斜率两个优点，并且具有较低的关态 电流。然后，本论文研究了栅极功函数对GAS GAA TFET双极性效 应的影响，并通过4.4eV的栅极功函数缓解GASGAATFET的双极性 效应。接着，在纳米管MOSFETs加工工艺的基础上，设计了 GAS GAATFET的加工流程。
接下来，本论文提出了 O-GAS GAATFET和P-GAS GAATFET 两种器件。研究发现，O-GAS GAATFET中的Overlap结构可以抑制 器件沟道和漏极接触位置的电场-Overlap长度为6zmi的O-GAS GAA TFET的关态电流约为GAS GAA TFET的17.8%,因此，Overlap结 构可以降低TFETs器件的关态电流，O-GAS GAA TFET具有低关态 电流的优点。P-GAS GAATFET通过在器件的源极和沟道接触处增加 一块n型Pocket,使器件的源极价带与沟道导带向下弯曲并且更加靠 近，进而提升器件发生带带隧穿的概率。Pocket掺杂浓度为4X 1018cm~3 的 P-GAS GAA TFET 的开态电流相比于 GAS GAA TFET 提升了 3.9%,因此，Pocket结构可以提升TFETs器件的开态电流， P-GAS GAATFET具有高开态电流的优点。最后，本论文以GAS GAA TFET加工流程为基础，分别设计了 O-GAS GAATFET和P-GAS GAA TFET的加工流程。

STRUCTURAL DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION OF NOVEL GATE-ALL-AROUND TUNNELING FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS
ABSTRACT
Over the years, with the rapid, development of integrated circuits, the process size of transistors has shrunk from the micron level to the nanometer level. This reduction in process size has led to increased integration and improved performance of integrated circuits. However, as the process size shrinks, secondary effects such as short-channel effect, narrow-channel effect, and drain introduction barrier reduction effect become more and more obvious in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), which not only affect the performance of transistors, but also hinder the continuation of Moore's law. Therefore, researchers at home and abroad have started to study new transistors, expecting that these problems can be solved. Tunnelling field-effect transistors (TFETs) are one of the most promising new devices for nextgeneration integrated circuits because of their low power consumption, ability to break the Boltzmann limit of 60mV/dec, and high switching current ratio based on the band-and-band tunneling operation principle. However, TFETs devices have the disadvantages of bipolar effect, low open-state current, and unstable subthreshold slope. To address the drawbacks of TFETs, the following studies are conducted in this thesis.
First, this thesis proposes a novel TFET device: the germanium- around-source gate-all-around tunneling field-effect transistor (GAS GAA TFET). Three devices, GAS GAA TFET, silicon source gate-all-around TFET (Si GAA TFET) and germanium source gate-all-around TFET (Ge- source GAA TFET), are simulated by Sentaurus TCAD. The experimental results show that the on-state current of the GAS GAA TFET reaches the same level as that of the Ge-source GAA TFET, which is about 104 times that of the Si GAA TFET, while the off-state current of the GAS GAA TFET is reduced to one-fifth that of the Ge-source GAA TFET. In addition, the variance of the subthreshold slope of the GAS GAA TFET is the smallest among the three devices, proving that the subthreshold slope of the GAS GAA TFET is more stable than the other two devices. Thus, the GAS GAA TFET has the two advantages of high on-state current and stable subthreshold slope, and has a low off-state current. Then, this thesis investigates the effect of gate work function on the bipolar effect of GAS GAA TFETs and mitigates the bipolar effect of GAS GAA TFETs by a gate work function of 4.4eV. Then, the processing flow of GAS GAA TFETs is designed based on the processing process of nanotube MOSFETs.
Next, two devices, O-GAS GAA TFET and P-GAS GAA TFET, are proposed in this thesis. It is found that the Overlap structure in the O-GAS GAA TFET can suppress the electric field at the device channel and drain contact locations, the off-state cuiTent of the O-GAS GAA TFET with an Overlap length of 6nm is about 17.8% of that of the GAS GAA TFET, so the Overlap structure can reduce the off-state Therefore, the Overlap structure can reduce the ofSstate current of TFETs devices, and O-GAS GAA TFETs have the advantage of low off-state current. P-GAS GAA TFETs are designed to increase the probability of band-tunneling by adding an n-type Pocket at the source-channel contact, which bends the source valence band downward and closer to the channel conduction band. The open-state current of P-GAS GAA TFETs with a Pocket doping concentration of 1018cm-3 is increased by 3.9% compared to that of GAS GAA TFETs. Therefore, the Pocket structure can increase the openstate current of TFETs devices, and P-GAS GAA TFETs have the advantage of high open-state current. Finally, this thesis designs the processing flow of O-GAS GAA TFET and P-GAS GAA TFET based on the GAS GAA TFET processing flow, respectively.
